# Sentiment Analysis with BERT & Machine Learning
Sentiment analysis is the process of automatically determining whether a piece of text expresses a positive, negative, or neutral opinion. It is widely used in applications such as product reviews, customer feedback, and social media monitoring.

# what is ?
Sentiment Analysis with BERT & Machine Learning is a text classification project that predicts whether a review is Positive, Negative, or Neutral. It compares traditional models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest with TF-IDF) against a fine-tuned BERT transformer, showing how deep learning achieves higher accuracy in understanding sentiments.

# ðŸŽ¯ Goals
Preprocess and clean customer review text data.
Build baseline models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.) using TF-IDF features.
Fine-tune BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for sentiment classification.
Compare performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) between traditional ML and BERT.
Understand customer opinions better to help businesses improve decision-making.
ðŸ›  Technical Details
Data Preprocessing: Tokenization, stopword removal, lowercasing, lemmatization, and TF-IDF vectorization.
Baseline Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and NaÃ¯ve Bayes.
Deep Learning Model: BERT fine-tuned for text classification.
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix.
Libraries Used:
pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
scikit-learn for ML models
transformers for BERT fine-tuning
torch for deep learning
# ðŸ“Š Case Explanation
